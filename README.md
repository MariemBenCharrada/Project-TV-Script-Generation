# Project-TV-Script-Generation
This project is part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program powered by Bertelsmann

## Project overview

In this project, I generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I used part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I built generated a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
